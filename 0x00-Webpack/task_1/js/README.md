Using jQuery

Create a js directory with a javascript file named dashboard_main.js in it. The file should import jquery and add the below elements in the following order:
Paragraph element: Holberton Dashboard
Paragraph element: Dashboard data for the students
Button element with the text Click here to get started
Add a paragraph element as so <p id='count'></p>
Add another paragraph: Copyright - Holberton School

Prevent spammers

Write a function called updateCounter() that tracks the number of times the button element has been clicked.
Each time it’s called, update the count by 1 and set the content of the paragraph element with id=‘count’ to {count} clicks on the button
Bind the debounce function in Lodash to the click event on the button you created previously.
